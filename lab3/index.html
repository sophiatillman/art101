<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
<p>The main idea of this lab was to further create a local file sturcture on my computer and add index.html files.</p>
<h1>Challenges</h1>
<p>It was very difficult to upload an image. I also found it very difficult to make my html files work correctly.</p>
<h1>Results</h1>
<p>I was finally able to get the results I wanted!</p>
